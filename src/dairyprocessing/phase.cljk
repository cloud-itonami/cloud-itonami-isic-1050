  "Phase gate for the dairy-processing actor rollout (0->3 maturity).
  Phase 0: simulation/test only (no real batch processing)
  Phase 1: supervised operation (high-stakes ops require pre-approval)
  Phase 2: reduced supervision (escalate only on conflict/low confidence)
  Phase 3: full autonomy (LLM confidence sufficient for routine ops)

  See `operation.cljc` for how the phase gate is invoked. Real production
  batches (`:log-production-batch` / `:coordinate-shipment`) ALWAYS require
  human sign-off regardless of phase (that's a separate `high-stakes?` gate)."

  Phase 1 (Supervised):

  Phase 2 (Reduced Supervision):
    - Escalate only on Governor violation or low confidence

  Phase 3 (Full Autonomy):
    - Commit if Governor approves, escalate only on Guard violation"
