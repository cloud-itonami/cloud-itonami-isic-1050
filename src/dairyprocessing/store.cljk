(ns dairyprocessing.store
  "Store abstraction for dairy processing batches. Current implementation is
  an in-memory map; production should migrate to Datomic/kotoba-server (the
  same seam point all cloud-itonami actors use).

  A processing batch is the minimal unit of work: one delivery of milk from
  a supplier, tracked through intake, pasteurization, cooling, and shipment.
  Each batch has:
    - :id unique batch identifier (UUID / SKU)
    - :jurisdiction country code (US/JP/EU/etc)
    - :product-type what was delivered (whole-milk / skim-milk / yogurt / cheese)
    - :received-at timestamp when batch arrived
    - :raw-milk-temp-c actual measured temperature at receive
    - :scc-cells-ml Somatic Cell Count (raw milk quality)
    - :tbc-cfu-ml Total Bacterial Count (raw milk quality)
    - :pasteurization-temp-c actual temperature during pasteurization
    - :pasteurization-hold-time-sec actual hold time at temperature
    - :cooling-temp-c temperature after cooling
    - :holding-time-hours cumulative time after pasteurization
    - :sanitation-score 0-100, third-party audit within 7 days
    - :pathogen-test-result map of {:listeria-negative?, :salmonella-negative?, :ecoli-negative?}
    - :contamination-flag-raised? true if concern surfaced during intake/processing
    - :contamination-flag-resolved? true only if concern is verified cleared
    - :processed? true once processing operation committed
    - :shipment-finalized? true once shipment operation committed"
