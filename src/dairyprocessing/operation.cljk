(ns dairyprocessing.operation
  "OperationActor -- one dairy-processing operation = one supervised actor run,
  expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The advisor (DairyProcessingAdvisor)
  is sealed into a single node (:advise); its proposal is ALWAYS routed
  through the Dairy Processing Governor (:govern) and the rollout phase gate
  (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore today; Datomic/kotoba-server is the next seam)
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)

  One graph run = one dairy-processing operation (intake -> advise -> govern ->
  decide -> commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner loop -- each
  operation is auditable and checkpointed. A batch's life is advanced by
  MANY operations (flag-concern / log-batch / shipment), each its own
  independent run.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the
  decision to a human operator (plant manager / dairy safety officer). The
  approver resumes with `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or :rejected).
  `:log-production-batch`/`:coordinate-shipment` ALWAYS reach this node
  when the Governor is clean -- see `dairyprocessing.phase`.

  NOTE: langgraph integration is deferred. This stub version defines the
  high-level flow; production build requires langgraph-clj."
